1. Experiment with numerical feature scaling and not scaling 
2. Reducing high-cardinality features into fewer bins
3. plotting the cardinality of each feature 
4. Plotting range of numerical features 
5. experiment with removing a certain number of features 
6. Experiment with different types of logistic regression (saga, sag, newton-cg)
